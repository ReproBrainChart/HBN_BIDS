## HBN RBC README
This is the neuroimaging dataset for the Healthy Brain Network (HBN). HBN is a study of childhood development
collected by the Child Mind Instute located in New York, NY. HBN was collected at four New York Metropolitan Area sites.  

This version of the dataset was curated at the University of Pennsylvania by the Lifespan Informatics 
and Neuroimaging Center (PennLINC) as part of the "Reproducible Brain Chart" (RBC) Initiative. RBC seeks to aggregate, 
organize QA, process, curate, and openly disseminate many of the largest cross-sectional studies of brain development.
